# PORTFOLIO

## About myself 
Hi, my name is Iryna Mirkevych. 
I would be happy to work as a software tester. 
I have been working as a "legal tester" (mostly in capital markets and financing) with successfully testing the projects and procedures from a legal perspective. I also have experience as a trainee manual tester.

I do have a testerâ€™s mindset and desire to find and fix bugs, as well as to make improvements. 
My previous experience makes me feel like I can be a good software tester because I practice things as follow: 
- business- and result-oriented approach
- finding balance among business interest, speed, quality, and actual ability to reach certain goals
- constant switching between levels (attention to detail while keeping in mind the whole system and ultimate aims)
